# Hugo fuse-search

Drop-in ready-to-use search solution for static site generator [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo).

The goal of this project is a ready-to-use package to paste into your Hugo theme to allow for dynamic search 
functionality within your Hugo website. Various customizable components will be included.

The basis of this project is [this GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/cmod/5410eae147e4318164258742dd053993) by Craig Mod. My aim is to expand what he has created to something that can be easily included in any Hugo theme.
